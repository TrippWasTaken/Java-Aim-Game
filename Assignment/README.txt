DT211C/2 OOP ASSIGNMENT


Cursor file must be in the Assignment folder where the .project file is otherwise the cursor will appear as nothing.
all sound files must also be there or they will just throw an error in console


For my OOP Project I have created a game. This game spawns circles in random positions on the screen and the user must click them.
if the player fails to do so and a circles fades from the screen, a life is taken away from the player, the game gets harder
depending on the score of the player. If the player is holding big combos the difficulty will increase much faster as their 
score will also rise much faster.

The aim of this game is to help with aim training for games like shooters by testing their reaction time and mouse accuracy.
